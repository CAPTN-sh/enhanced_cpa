# Enhancing Closest Point of Approach (eCPA)

Welcome to the official repository for the paper titled **"Steering Towards Maritime Safety with True Motion Predictions Ensemble"** presented at the ACSOS 2024 - Self-Improving Systems Integration Workshop.

## Overview
This repository contains the code implementation of our Just-In-Time (JIT) tool designed to enhance the performance of the Closest Point of Approach (CPA) calculations. Our approach leverages ensemble prediction methods to improve the accuracy and reliability of ship motion forecasting, thereby promoting maritime safety.
